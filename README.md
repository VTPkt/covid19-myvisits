# covid19-myvisits
Track your visits with larger groups of people. In case of a covid-19 infection, your health institute may ask you where you have been in the last 28 days. This might be hard to remember. The app might help.

This is my first code project for iPhone - so please have mercy on me. Feel free to contribute in any way to this project.


Thanks
Florian
